This project contains (in the v2_xdma directory) the significantly modified driver for Xilinx XDMA IP core, together with the HDL code. It allows high-speed cyclic transfer to the huge memory buffers directly mapped to the application memory.

The v1_dmover directory contains the uncompleted driver for the PCIe DMA based on the DataMover and AXI MMapped to Memory block.
